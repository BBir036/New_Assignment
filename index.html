                        West Indian skipper Hetmyer had earlier laid the foundation for the successful chase with his breezy 
                            innings. He smashed 60 at better than a run a ball to change the complexion of the match For Bangladesh,
                             it was a day to forget in the field as several catches were dropped and silly fielding errors were 
                             committed during this vital game. Saleh Ahmed Shawon was Bangladesh's most successful bowler today.
                              He took three wickets for 37 runs in 10 overs. Both Mehedi and Saifuddin took two wickets each. 
                              Saifuddin struck in the 47th over when West Indies needed 10 runs from 23 balls to win. Frew tried to squeeze a full-ball to third man but only managed to get an edge to keeper. The West Indian player hung around to take his team close to victory. Saleh Ahmed Shawon of Bangladesh struck twice in the 38th over to stall West Indies as the visitors crept towards the target.Bangladesh players broke into wild celebrations as Shawon got the better of Paul and bowled the West Indian batter for four. West Indies seemed to lose the plot as they approached the finish-line. Goolie was trapped in front by Shawon with a flat delivery on middle and leg. Umpire didn't hesitate as it looked quite plumb!Saifuddin gave Bangladesh a timely wicket, that too of the West Indies captain Hetmyer in the 28th over against the run of play. Shimron literally threw away his wicket after a great start, he tried to slog across the line, the slower ball deceived him and he was caught by Saif. He scored 60 runs from 59 balls with seven fours and a six, but more importantly kept the Bangladeshi bowlers at bay.
